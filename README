# OpenEPS (Open Ensemble Prediction System)

This is a versatile Ensemble Prediction System that provides the
framework for running ensembles of different applications. So far
scripts are available for running OpenIFS and a very simple testcase.
There is still quite much to do, and the structure will likely
be changed until everything is clean and understandable.
So, please be patient when using!

Workflow: (items in [] are TBD)
./openEPS
1) Read in configuration files that define both system and model
   specific resources, paths, needed scripts, etc.
   (configs/$MODEL/exp.$NAME)
   (configs/$MODEL/env.$HOST)

2) Test all needed files etc. are present
   (scripts/general_test.bash)
   [this needs still some clean up]

3) Initialize experiment
    - Create experiment structure (create paths, copy scripts)
    - Calculate resource allocation, i.e. how much can be run
      parallel
   [- Modify patch job resource requirements ]
    - Adjust model namelist(s) accordingly
    - Adjust post processing scripts  
   (scripts/general_init.bash)  

 4) Submit batchjob, or launch a new bash shell
    Note that this job should be written separately for each model
    (so far OpenIFS and testcase have this)!
    - Generate parallel structure for data [ SHOULD BE MOVED ]
    - Generate input for first date [ SHOULD BE MOVED ]
    - Define targets and rules for makefile [ SHOULD BE RESTUCTURED ]
    - Loope over datelist, and for each date
      i)  Write out an explicit makefile
      ii) Execute the makefile

Job scheduling is handled via the makefile, the workflow within
the makefile may depend on the application. For instance, OpenIFS
can be run in
"forecasts only"-mode:
1) link initial states for each ens member
2) once initial states are available, run the model
3) once model output is available, go to next date

[ "EPS emulator"-mode ]
[ "parameter estimation"-mode ]

ISSUES/TBD (6th June 2017):

iii) There is no real initial state generation process now. Hopefully 
Glenn's solution for the vertical and horizontal resolution changes are
easy for you to implement. My idea was to do the resolution changes within
the job to minimize the need for diskspace (remember to delete all 
unnecessary files after a date!), this would also allow for a flexible
system if the system is run with different resolutions.

vi) Cost function calculation needs an analysis field to which it can
compare the forecast to. The model initial (control) states can be used
as these, but I'd suggest extracting the necessary fields out and storing
them somewhere prior to runs so the file reading won't take so long.
